This app is just a very humble wrapper to make more convenient use of the Cologne Digital Sanskrit Dictionaries. I cannot even begin to imagine the amount of work it took to produce the actual dictionaries. Thank you for making the dictionaries and for releasing them in such a way that made this app possible.
